          <h2>Description: </h2>
          This is a website that I have created for one of my first clients. I worked with Carla to create the design, layout, and content of the website to bring her business on to the web. This site highlights my goal to create simple and elegant websites that get out of the way of the content. The website consists of three pages: the home page showing her most impressive work, an about me page where visitors can learn about her and contact her, and a gallery page with albums of some of the work she would like to showcase.

      Building a website is an art, and there are many tools available to web developers right now to create them. Here are a couple of skills and tools I emply in projects:

<section id="skills">
  <div class="skill-container" id="html">
    <div class="skill-icon" id="html-icon"></div>
    <h1>HTML, CSS, Javascript</h1>
    <div class="skill-content" id="html-content">
      HTML, CSS, and Javascript are a staple of any web developers toolkit. A majority of my experience and time has been spent creating and cultivating static website creation. Aside from the basic languages, I now work with the SASS preprocessor and the Jquery library to help increase programming efficiency and website capacities.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="skill-container" id="ang">
    <div class="skill-icon" id="ang-icon"></div>
    <h1>Angular 2</h1>
    <div class="skill-content" id="ang-content">
      To diversify my skills and to allow for more dynamic and robust website building, I have employed the use of Angular 2 in my web applications. Angular 2 is my first choice in a front end framework for its delivery of an entire website framework and the use of Typescript as its main language.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="skill-container" id="node">
    <div class="skill-icon" id="node-icon"></div>
    <h1>Node.Js</h1>
    <div class="skill-content" id="node-content">
      For all of my backend coding, I use node.js. Node allows for the use of one language throughout the entire stack, javascript, which has become my most enjoyed and used language in my kit. Along with the use of Express, Mongoose, and NPM, I have created applications with fully functioning databases and dynamic functionality.
